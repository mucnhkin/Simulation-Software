# University of Massachusetts Dartmouth UUV SIM

### 8/22/25
* Set up the project to be more user friendly and include a README
* Added very basic agent that is viewable on the map
* map.py setup to control and build the maps from shapefiles and retrieve data
* model.py setup and controls the model of the simulation (just calls the agent to move for now)
* agent.py setup and controls the agent which only moves to a hard coded target
* Overall went ahead and organized, fixed issues, and comments
